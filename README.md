# Twine Stories

 Linear stories for text-based adventure games using Twine. I plan to take the structure and format to build the world and then eventually import into either Unity or a JS based format for play. I started down this path using a Unity tutorial on [Text-Based Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAf1I1UWo5Q&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RfcpqpKlmLEy7NteIog8g4&index=1) and decided to dig deeper. Games like Zork are classics. A good collection of current playable games are at https://textadventures.co.uk/.

## Applications

- [Twine](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs) and [Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/index.html)
- [Cradle](https://github.com/daterre/Cradle) to import into Unity.
- [Encrusted](https://github.com/DeMille/encrusted). Something I might end up using once I have a viable story. Bookmarking for now.

## Libraries

- [TypewiterJS](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs). Eventually I'll figure out how to use this.
- [Harlowe](https://twine2.neocities.org/). As the Twine Story Formatting engine.
- [SugarCube](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/). Another Tine Story Formatting engine that I plan to try.
