# Twine Stories
 Linear stories for text-based adventure games using Twine. I plan to take the structure and format to build the world and then eventually import into either Unity or a JS based format for playthroughs. I started down this path using a Unity tutorial on [Text-Based Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAf1I1UWo5Q&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RfcpqpKlmLEy7NteIog8g4&index=1) and decided to dig deeper. 
 
## Applications: 
- [Twine](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs) 
- [Cradle](https://github.com/daterre/Cradle) to import into Unity.
- [Encrusted](https://github.com/DeMille/encrusted). Something I might end up using once I have a viable story. Bookmarking for now.
